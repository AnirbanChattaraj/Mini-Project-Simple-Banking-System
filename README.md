💰 Mini Banking System in C 💻

A fun, console-based banking adventure built purely with C basics—loops, if-else, and input/output. Experience the thrill of managing your virtual bank account without leaving your terminal!

🚀 Features

Check Balance – Keep an eye on your virtual fortune 💵

Deposit Money – Grow your wealth, one input at a time 💸

Withdraw Money – Spend wisely, don’t go broke! 🏦

Exit – Close your bank, but your balance lives on 🛑

🎯 How It Works

Starts with an initial balance (1000.0 by default).

Displays a menu-driven interface with four options.

Accepts user input and performs operations until you choose to exit.

Validates deposits and withdrawals to prevent “oops” moments.

Dynamically updates your balance after each transaction.

💡 Code Highlights

Loops: do-while keeps the action going until exit.

Conditionals: if-else handles your every banking decision.

Input/Output: scanf & printf make the interaction smooth and simple.
